# twitter-demo
This is in essence a Spring Boot application that will connect to the public Twitter Stream API
and read som sample data before storing these data into a MongoDB instance.

It's based heavily upon sample code provided by Twitter and was written to verify,
that my own Twitter API key is configured correctly.
